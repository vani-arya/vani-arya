# Hi, I'm Vani 👋

I'm starting my journey in development and real-world projects.

- Currently learning: Python, Git/GitHub, and how projects are managed.
- Interested in: Building useful tools, working with teams, and understanding how ideas become real products.
- Goal: Gain hands-on experience by contributing to development / project work.

This profile will start filling up with my learning progress and mini projects soon 🚀
